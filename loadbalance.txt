-> Login to aws using ubuntu index
-> install nginx(if not present sudo apt-get install nginx)
-> move to nginx folder
	-> cd /etc/nginx
	-> sudo nano nginx.conf
	-> Remove everything  and start typing
		-> events {
			worker_connections 768;
		   }
		   http {
			upstream myapp {
				server public_ip_addres:port weight = 1;
				server public_ip_addres:port weight = 1;
			}
			server {
				location / {
					proxy_pass http://myapp;
				}
			}
		   }
-> Save everything, note space metter.
-> sudo nginx -t (for test if ok)
-> sudo service nginx restart
-> Now run simple load balance done. weight 1 and 1 meand 50%
-> Now for healt check set healthcheck directive, default health check interval is 5second
	location / {
			proxy_pass http://myapp;
			health_check;
	}
	-> Increase healtchecking interval
		health_check interval=20 fails=3 passes=2;
		Interval increase to 20second
-> Now set some parameter that will decide server is unavilable or not, default is 10second
	upstream myapp{
		server 127.0.0.1:8100 max_fails=2 fail_timeout=30s;
		server 127.0.0.1:8200 max_fails=2 fail_timeout=30s;
	}
	Here max_fails and fail_timeout means within 30s ther server shoul faild 2 request, then it mark as         unavailable
-> Now anither things is taht after recover unavailable server send request slowly slowly we need to set
	server 127.0.0.1:8100 max_fails=2 slow_start=30s;
